## <b>GTZC_TZSC_MPCBB_TrustZone Example Description</b>

How to use HAL GTZC MPCBB to build any example with illegal Access detection when TrustZone security is activated **(Option bit TZEN=1)**.

The purpose of this example is to declare the SRAM3 (starting from 0x20040000) as non-secure
with HAL GTZC MPCBB services and to demonstrate that a security violation is detected when non-secure application accesses secure SRAM1 memory.

In non-secure application, LED GREEN is TOGGLING.
The security violation detection at MPCBB level is triggered by pressing the USER push-button key:

Any key press on USER push-button initiates an access in secure SRAM1 (SRAM1 base address).
The illegal Access is detected from the secure application.
After returning to non-secure application, the GREEN LED is ON to indicate that illegal access
is detected by the secure application.

This project is composed of two sub-projects:

- one for the secure application part (xxxxx_S)
- one for the non-secure application part (xxxxx_NS).

Please remember that on system with security enabled:

- the system always boots in secure and the secure application is responsible for
launching the non-secure application.
- the SystemInit() function in secure application sets up the SAU/IDAU, FPU and
secure/non-secure interrupts allocations defined in partition_stm32u575xx.h file.

This project shows how to switch from secure application to non-secure application
thanks to the system isolation performed to split the internal Flash and internal SRAM memories
into two halves:

 - the first half for the secure application and
 - the second half for the non-secure application.

The NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q (MB1549) board LED GREEN can be used to monitor the transfer status:

 -  **LED_GREEN is TOGGLING** in non-secure (waiting for USER push-button key press),
 -  **LED_GREEN is ON** when the illegal access on internal SRAM1 is detected,

User Option Bytes configuration:

Please note the internal Flash is fully secure by default in TZEN=1 and User Option Bytes
SECWM1_PSTRT/SECWM1_PEND and SECWM2_PSTRT/SECWM2_PEND should be set according to the application
configuration. Here the proper User Option Bytes setup in line with the project linker/scatter
file is as follows:

  - TZEN=1
  - SECWM1_PSTRT=0x0  SECWM1_PEND=0x7F  meaning all 128 pages of Bank1 set as secure
  - SECWM2_PSTRT=0x1  SECWM2_PEND=0x0   meaning no page of Bank2 set as secure, hence Bank2 non-secure

This project is targeted to run on STM32U5 device on boards from STMicroelectronics.

This example configures the maximum system clock frequency at 160Mhz.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.
 3. The following sequence is needed to disable TrustZone:

      - **Boot from user Flash memory**:
         a.	Make sure that secure and non-secure applications are well loaded and executed (jump done on non-secure application).
         b.	If not yet done, set RDP to level 1 through STM32CubeProgrammer. Then only Hotplug connection is possible during non-secure application execution.
         c.	Use a power supply different from ST-LINK in order to be able to connect to the target.
         d.	Uncheck the TZEN box and set RDP to level 0 (option byte value 0xAA), then click on Apply.

     - **Boot from RSS**:
         a.	Make sure to apply a high level on BOOT0 pin (make sure that nSWBOOT0 Option Byte is checked).
         b.	If not yet done, set RDP to level 1 through STM32CubeProgrammer. Then only Hotplug connection is possible during non-secure application execution.
         c.	Use a power supply different from ST-LINK in order to be able to connect to the target.
         d.	Uncheck the TZEN box and set RDP to level 0 (option byte value 0xAA), then click on Apply.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32U575xx devices with security enabled (TZEN=1).

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q (MB1549)
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)

    - TZEN=1                              System with TrustZone-M enabled
