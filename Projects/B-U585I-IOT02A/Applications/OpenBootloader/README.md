## <b>OpenBootloader Application Description</b>

This application exploits OpenBootloader Middleware to demonstrate how to develop an IAP application
and how use it.

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)
to run at 60 Mhz.

Then, these protocols and memories interfaces are configured:

  - USART3
  - FDCAN1
  - I2C2
  - SPI1
  - USB
  - FLASH interface
  - RAM interface
  - Option bytes interface
  - Engi bytes interface
  - OTP interface
  - System memory interface

Then, the OpenBootloader application will wait for incoming communication on one of the supported protocols.

Once a communication is established through one of the supported protocols,
the OpenBootloader application will wait for commands sent by the host.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. In case of Mass Erase operation, the OpenBootloader FLASH area must be protected otherwise the OpenBootloader
    will be erased.

 2. The current implementation of write in option bytes doesnâ€™t support writing in OEMKEYR option bytes.
    The OEMKEYR option bytes registers programming can be easily added at the end of the function OPENBL_OB_Write in the file optionbytes_interface.c

 3. In the `OpenBootloader_Init()` function in `app_openbootloader.c` file, the user can:
       - Select the list of supported commands for a specific interface by defining its own list of commands.

       Here is an example of how to customize USART interface commands list, here only read/write commands are supported:

        OPENBL_CommandsTypeDef USART_Cmd =
        {
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          OPENBL_USART_ReadMemory,
          OPENBL_USART_WriteMemory,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL
        };

        USART_Handle.p_Ops = &USART_Ops;
        USART_Handle.p_Cmd = &USART_Cmd;           /* Initialize the USART handle with the list of supported commands */
        OPENBL_USART_SetCommandsList(&USART_Cmd);  /* Register the list of supported commands in MW side */

       - Use the default list of supported commands for a specific interface by reusing the commands list defined in MW side.

       Here is an example of how to use USART interface default commands list:

        /* Register USART interfaces */
        USART_Handle.p_Ops = &USART_Ops;
        USART_Handle.p_Cmd = OPENBL_USART_GetCommandsList();  /* Initialize the USART handle with the default list osupported commands */
